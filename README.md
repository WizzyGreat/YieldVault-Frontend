# YieldVault Frontend

A React + Vite frontend for **YieldVault**, a Soroban DeFi yield vault on the
Stellar network. The app lets users browse vaults, deposit and withdraw, and
track their positions and earned yield.

> This build runs entirely on mock data — no network calls are made — so it
> works offline for development and demos.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173.

To use custom network settings, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and edit
the values. All variables are optional.
